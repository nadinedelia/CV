## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Thinking outside the box

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Interdisciplinary

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- 2.1

One of the most prestigious dance universities in the whole of Europe. 
While studiying there, I participated in various outercurriculum activities and projects. 
I was chosen in the second year of my degree as one of only 4 students to collaborate on a weekly basis with Central Saint Martins for a project called Design for Dance.
I took this as an opportunity to choreograph a piece based on geometrical shapes and algorithms, therefore merging my fascination of mathematics with the creative arts. Following this path, I decided in my 3rd year to dedicate my dissertation piece to chemical reactions and formulas.

#### University of Zurich, Switzerland (2013 – 2014)
