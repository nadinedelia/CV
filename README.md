## Who am I? 

*Professional Dancer turned Junior Full Stack Developer*

A proactive, energised, and creative **Full Stack Software Developer** by day. A dance, music, fitness and pizza aficionado by night.

As I take genuine pleasure in dissecting ideas and concepts to examine what works and what doesn’t, I decided to study at Makers Academy, one of Europe's leading coding bootcamps.

## Skills

#### Organization | Communication | Team work
##### ...and a healthy dose of multitasking

- Arranging events for companies like UBS Switzerland
- Planning and directing multiple dance and art performances
- working closely with artists and organisation commitees to bring an event to life


#### Leadership
##### aka keeping my calm and nerves at all times

I'm experienced in leading and managing a team of up to 200 people.
In my previous positions I was assisting the CEO, handling day to day business and instructed to improve and monitor sales.
I was recruiting new managers and staff and was also instructed in training them.


#### Creativity | Adaptability | Interdisciplinarity 
##### aka "Thinking outside the box"

New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. None of these are a problem, only opportunities. I have worked around the world with huge diversity of people in a vast variety of field. There is always a way to connect.

Merging my fascination of tech and science with the creative arts was always a path I wanted to follow. I like to find inspiration and ideas for problem solving within differend fields – related or not - to make the finished product as good as it can be.
I'm a firm believer in the potential of gaining a variety of skills for vast improvement and invention.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2020 – August 2020)

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine


#### London Studio Centre (2014 – 2017)

- BA(Hons) Theatre Dance
- 2.1

*One of the most prestigious dance universities in the whole of Europe, validated by Middlesex University.*

**Fun Fact:**
I was chosen in the second year of my degree as one of only 4 students to collaborate on a weekly basis with Central Saint Martins for a project called 'Design for Dance', which I took this as an opportunity to choreograph a piece based on geometrical shapes and algorithms.
Following this path, I decided in my 3rd year to dedicate my dissertation piece to chemical reactions and formulas. 
Now I'd like to reverse this process to bring my creative thinking to software development.


#### University of Zurich, Switzerland (2013 – 2014)

BA(Hons) Media Science and Economics
