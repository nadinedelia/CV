## Who am I? 

www.nadine-loe.com

*Professional Dancer turned Junior Full Stack Developer*

A proactive, energized, and creative **Full Stack Software Developer** by day. A dance, music, fitness, and pizza professional by night.

As I take genuine pleasure in dissecting ideas and concepts to examine what works and what doesn’t, I decided to study at Makers Academy, one of Europe's leading coding bootcamps.

## Skills

#### Organization | Communication | Teamwork
##### ...and a healthy dose of multitasking

Communication, organization, and teamwork are key ingredients to be a successful hospitality and event manager. To create something special which will have a legacy, everyone must be on the same page.
I'm grateful to have had experience in a variety of fields with an intense amount of different people, which all taught me valuable skills. During my career, I was arranging events for companies like UBS Switzerland, planning and directing multiple dance and art performances, and working closely with artists and committees to bring an event to life.

As a Personal Trainer, I perfected my communication skills, was very self-organized and was working with clients to assess their needs to give them a specialized and tailored experience.

#### Leadership
##### aka keeping my calm and nerves at all times

I had my first supervisor job at the age of 20, leading a team where everyone was older than me. From there, it took me years to perfect the way I deal with people, to be the best leader I can be. I strive to find the bliss point where the interests of the company and the employees are simultaneously met and where everyone feels heard and important. During my time as an operations manager, I was overseeing more than 20 bars in Shoreditch, as well as assisting the CEO, handling day to day business, and improving and monitor sales. I was recruiting new managers and staff and was also instructed in training them. This and other roles taught me a lot about how to interact with teams and employees, and how to just stay still, breathe and think calmly, even in stressful situations.


#### Creativity | Adaptability | Interdisciplinarity 
##### aka "Thinking outside the box"

New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. None of these are a problem, only opportunities. I have worked around the world with a huge diversity of people in a vast variety of fields. There is always a way to connect.

Merging my fascination with tech and science with the creative arts was always a path I wanted to follow. I like to find inspiration and ideas for problem-solving within different fields – related or not - to make the finished product as good as it can be.
I'm a firm believer in the potential of gaining a variety of skills for vast improvement and invention.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2020 – August 2020)

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine


#### London Studio Centre (2014 – 2017)

- BA(Hons) Theatre Dance
- 2.1

*One of the most prestigious dance universities in the whole of Europe, validated by Middlesex University.*

**Fun Fact:**
I was chosen in the second year of my degree as one of only 4 students to collaborate weekly with Central Saint Martins for a project called 'Design for Dance', which I took this as an opportunity to choreograph a piece based on geometrical shapes and algorithms.
Following this path, I decided in my 3rd year to dedicate my dissertation piece to chemical reactions and formulas. 
Now I'd like to reverse this process to bring my creative thinking to software development.


#### University of Zurich, Switzerland (2013 – 2014)

BA(Hons) Media Science and Economics
