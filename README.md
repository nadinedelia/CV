#### Why Web Development?

I'm an energized and creative individual who takes genuine pleasure in dissecting ideas and concepts to examine what works and what doesn’t. 
Always looking forward to solving complex problems, I'm certain that there's no better path for me to chose.



## Skills

#### Organization | Communication | Team work

- Arranging events for companies like UBS Switzerland
- Planning and directing multiple dance and art performances
- working closely with artists and organisation commitees to bring an event to life


#### Leadership

I'm experienced in leading and managing a team of up to 50 people.
In my previous positions I was assisting the CEO, handling day to day business and instructed to improve and monitor sales.
I was recruiting new managers and staff and was also instructed in training them.


#### Creativity | Adaptability | Interdisciplinarity 
#####     aka "Thinking outside the box"

Merging my fascination of tech and science with the creative arts was always a path I wanted to follow. I like to find inspiration and ideas for problem solving within differend fields – related or not - to make the finished product as good as it can be.
I'm a firm believer in the potential of gaining a variety of skills for vast improvement and invention.

I was chosen in the second year of my degree as one of only 4 students to collaborate on a weekly basis with Central Saint Martins for a project called 'Design for Dance', which I took this as an opportunity to choreograph a piece based on geometrical shapes and algorithms.
Following this path, I decided in my 3rd year to dedicate my dissertation piece to chemical reactions and formulas. 
Now I'd like to reverse this process to bring my creative thinking to software development.
